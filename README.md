# APP

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.9.


Since I am familiar with it, I use [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) for autocomplete, toolbar, datepicker components. 

[Echarts.js](https://echarts.apache.org/en/tutorial.html#Get%20Started%20with%20ECharts%20in%205%20minutes) seemed to be the perfect fit for the study case. 

I used [ngx-echart](https://xieziyu.github.io/ngx-echarts/#/welcome) on the top of it for Angular integration. This library was easy to use, but it started to be tricky when I try to customize some functionalities (ZoomData for example). I will use with parsimony in my next projects.
